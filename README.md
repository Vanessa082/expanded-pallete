# Mixing Palette

Mixing Palette is a creative animated demo built using the [Claudius](https://github.com/claudiusFX/Claudius) library for OCaml. It generates a dynamic, swirling gradient effect by blending three base colors (red, green, and blue) over time. The animation is driven by a function that blends the colors based on each pixel's distance and angle from the center of the screen, as well as the elapsed time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Color Blending:** Smoothly blends red, green, and blue to create a continuously evolving gradient.
- **Radial Animation:** Uses the distance and angle of each pixel from the center to drive the color mix, producing a swirling, radial effect.
- **Minimalistic & Creative:** A short and inspiring demo showcasing how to harness the power of Claudius for retro-style graphics.
